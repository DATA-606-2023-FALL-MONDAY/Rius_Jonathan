Assignment 03 - Proposal Developent

Review this requirements document The Template and Guidelines for the Project Proposal and Final Report Find a topic and data sources for that topic. Get the datasets. Create a Jupyter Notebook to explore the datasets. Save your Jupyter Notebook file in the src subfolder. Complete section 1, 2, 3 from the above document and save the document as "proposal.md" in your docs subfolder. This is a plain text file. Don't use Jupyter Notebook for this. You will be graded based on the following: The style and substance of your proposal The style and substance of your Jupyter Notebook

2. Background

Provide the background information about the chosen topic. 

The following is a study of macroeconmic data and using machine learning for economic forecasting. Hypothesis testing and correlations will be used for further exploration. Basically the project aims to explore macro economic data and make use of machine learning for forecasting.  

What is it about? See the above comment. 

Why does it matter? Forecasting and comparisons could be useful in making policy changes. 

What are your research questions?

What will inflation, GDP and unemployment rate look in the future?

How can we use hypothesis testing to compare macroeconomic data against other countries? 

What are some correlations between data sets?


3. Data
